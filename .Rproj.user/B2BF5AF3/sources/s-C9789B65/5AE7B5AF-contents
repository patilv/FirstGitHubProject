This is going to be awesome. I can't wait to send a link to this page to my friends on twitter.

# How many rows and columns?

This is my first line of *R* code

```{r}
# This is a comment.

# Number of rows

nrow(mtcars)

# number of columns
ncol(mtcars)

```

This dataset has `r nrow(mtcars)` rows and `r ncol(mtcars)` columns.

# Summary of the dataset

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

# My first r plot

```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$hp,xlab="Miles per gallon",ylab="Horse Power")
```
